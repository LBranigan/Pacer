  "description": "Here's a detailed textual description of an illustrative diagram representing the Pacer ORF Assessment Pipeline, based on the provided methodology section and figure caption:\n\n**Overall Layout:**\n\nThe diagram depicts a top-to-bottom, multi-stage pipeline. Each stage is represented by a rounded rectangular box with a descriptive title. The flow of data and processing is clearly indicated by downward-pointing arrows connecting the boxes. The background is a very light cream color.\n\n**Components and Connections:**\n\n1.  **Audio Input & Preprocessing:**\n    *   A rounded rectangle at the very top, labeled \"Student Audio Input (WAV/WebM)\" in bold sans-serif font. A small, muted grey icon of a microphone is placed to the left of the label. The fill color is a pale, buttery yellow. The border is a slightly darker shade of yellow.\n    *   An arrow with a solid black line points down to a rounded rectangle labeled \"Audio Preprocessing\" in bold sans-serif font.\n        *   Inside the \"Audio Preprocessing\" box, two sub-steps are listed vertically in regular sans-serif font: \"Pad with 500ms silence\" and \"Re-encode as LINEAR16 WAV\".\n    *   The \"Audio Preprocessing\" box has a soft light gray fill and a slightly darker gray border.\n\n2.  **Kitchen Sink Ensemble (Parallel ASR):**\n    *   A large rounded rectangle labeled \"Kitchen Sink Ensemble (Parallel ASR)\" in bold sans-serif font. The fill color is a light peach with a slightly darker peach border.\n    *   Inside this rectangle are three parallel processing branches:\n        *   **2a.

The sub-boxes have a slightly darker peach fill and border.\n            *   An arrow with a solid black line connects Pass 1 to Pass 2, indicating sequential processing.\n            *   Both passes output \"Word-level Timestamps\". This is noted with small text and arrows pointing out of each sub-box.\n        *   **2b. Cross-Validator (Parakeet/Deepgram Nova-3):** A rounded rectangle to the right of the Reverb STT box.\n            *   The text \"Backend Proxy (No CORS)\" is written below the box in smaller font.\n            *   The output is \"Word-level Transcript with Timestamps\".\n        *   Arrows from both Reverb passes and the Cross-Validator converge into a single downward arrow.\n        *   Labels on the converging arrows: \"Reverb Verbatim\", \"Reverb Clean\", \"XVal Transcript\", written in italicized serif font.\n\n3.  **Sequence Alignment & Disfluency Tagging:**\n    *   A rounded rectangle labeled \"Sequence Alignment (Reverb Verbatim vs. Clean)\" in bold sans-serif font. The fill color is a light sage green with a slightly darker green border.\n    *   Inside: \"Needleman-Wunsch Alignment\" in regular sans-serif font.\n    *   An arrow with a solid black line leads to \"Disfluency Tagging (Filler, Repeat, False Start)\" in regular sans-serif font.\n    *   Another arrow with a dashed black line comes from the Cross-Validator box into this stage, labeled \"Cross-Validation Results\" in italicized serif font.\n    *   The output of this stage is \"Disfluency-Tagged Transcript + Cross-Validation\" in italicized serif font.\n\n4.  **Reference Text Alignment:**\n    *   A rounded rectangle labeled \"Reference Text Alignment\" in bold sans-serif font. The fill color is a light orange with a slightly darker orange border.\n    *   Inside: \"Needleman-Wunsch with Graded Substitution\" in regular sans-serif font.\n    *   A small, muted grey icon representing a text document is placed on the left side of the box.\n    *   The input is \"Teacher-Provided Reference Text\" in italicized serif font.\n    *   Output: \"Aligned Transcript (Correct/Substitution/Omission/Insertion)\" in italicized serif font.\n\n5.  **Compound Word Merging:**\n    *   A rounded rectangle labeled \"Compound Word Merging\" in bold sans-serif font.
