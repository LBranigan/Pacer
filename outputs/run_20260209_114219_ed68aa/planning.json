The fill color is a light gray.\n    *   Inside, a bulleted list: \"Alignment View (Color-Coded)\", \"Tooltips (Click-to-Play)\", \"Word Speed Map (Visualization)\", \"Metric Boxes\". An icon representing a computer screen is placed on the left side of the box.\n\n**Connections:**\n\n*   All stages are connected by downward-pointing arrows, indicating the flow of data through the pipeline.\n*   Arrows are solid black lines with a line weight of 1.5pt.\n*   Labels are placed alongside the arrows to indicate the data being passed between stages (e.g., \"Aligned Transcript\", \"Disfluency-Tagged Transcript\").\n\n**Groupings:**\n\n*   The \"Kitchen Sink Ensemble\" is visually grouped using a larger rectangle that encompasses the Reverb STT and Cross-Validator modules.\n*   Each stage has a distinct background color to visually separate it from the others.\n\n**Labels and Annotations:**\n\n*   Each box has a clear and concise title in a sans-serif font (e.g., Arial, Helvetica).\n*   Additional annotations are used to provide more detail about the processing steps within each stage.\n*   Labels on arrows indicate the type of data being passed between stages.\n\n**Input/Output:**\n\n*   The input is \"Student Audio Input (WAV/WebM)\".\n*   The output is \"UI Rendering\", which represents the final visualization of the assessment results.\n\n**Styling:**\n\n*   The background is a very light pastel blue.\n*   The fill colors of the boxes are pastel shades (peach, green, orange, purple, turquoise, pink, yellow, cyan, violet, lime green, coral, brown, gray).\n*   Arrows are solid black lines with a line weight of 1.5pt.\n*   Font is sans-serif (Arial or Helvetica) for readability.\n*   Icons are simple and representational.\n",
