  "initial_description": "Here's a detailed textual description of a figure illustrating the Pacer ORF Assessment Pipeline, based on the provided methodology section and caption:\n\n**Overall Layout:**\n\nThe diagram will follow a left-to-right flow, representing the sequential stages of the pipeline. It will be divided into distinct sections, visually separated by light pastel colored backgrounds or very thin, dashed borders, to represent major processing phases. The overall style will be clean and modern, using simple shapes and clear labels.\n\n**Components and Connections:**\n\n1.  **Input:** On the far left, a rounded rectangle labeled \"Audio Blob\" represents the input audio. It's filled with a very light gray gradient to suggest an audio waveform. An arrow, medium thickness and dark gray, points from \"Audio Blob\" to the next stage.\n\n2.  **Padding:** A rectangular box labeled \"[Pad 500ms silence]\" follows the input. It has a white background and a thin black border. An arrow connects it to the \"Kitchen Sink Ensemble\".\n\n3.  **Kitchen Sink Ensemble:** This is a visually prominent section.  It consists of a larger, rounded rectangle labeled \"Kitchen Sink Ensemble\". Inside, three sub-modules are arranged vertically:\n\n    *   \"Reverb v1.0 (verbatim: CTC wenet, CTM timestamps, preserves disfluencies)\" - A rectangular box with a light yellow background.\n    *   \"Reverb v0.0 (clean: disfluency suppression)\" - A rectangular box with a light green background.\n    *   \"Parakeet/Deepgram Nova-3 (cross-validator, primary timekeeper)\" - A rectangular box with a light blue background.\n\n    Each sub-module has an arrow originating from the \"Kitchen Sink Ensemble\" entry point, visually branching out. These arrows are slightly thinner than the main flow arrows and are colored dark gray. The \"Kitchen Sink Ensemble\" box has a light orange border and a slightly darker orange fill than the sub-modules.\n\n4.  **NW Sequence Alignment:** A rectangular box labeled \"NW Sequence Alignment (verbatim vs clean)\" follows the Kitchen Sink Ensemble. It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the Kitchen Sink Ensemble outputs to this box.\n\n5.  **Disfluency Tags:** A rectangular box labeled \"Disfluency Tags (filler, repeat, false-start)\" is placed to the right of the \"NW Sequence Alignment\" box. It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"NW Sequence Alignment\" output to this box.\n\n6.  **Cross-Validation Merge:** A rectangular box labeled \"Cross-Validation Merge (confirmed / disagreed / unconfirmed per word)\" is placed to the right of the \"Disfluency Tags\" box.  It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"Disfluency Tags\" output to this box.\n\n7.  **NW Alignment vs Reference Text:** A rectangular box labeled \"NW Alignment vs Reference Text (graded substitution: -1.5\u00d7(1-levRatio); \u2192 correct/substitution/omission/insertion)\" is placed to the right of the \"Cross-Validation Merge\" box. It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"Cross-Validation Merge\" output to this box.\n\n8.  **Compound Word Merge:** A rectangular box labeled \"Compound Word Merge (\\\"hot\\\"+\\\"dog\\\"\u2192\\\"hotdog\\\")\" is placed to the right of the \"NW Alignment vs Reference Text\" box. It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"NW Alignment vs Reference Text\" output to this box.\n\n9.  **Omission Recovery:** A rectangular box labeled \"Omission Recovery (unconsumed xval words heal omissions)\" is placed to the right of the \"Compound Word Merge\" box. It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"Compound Word Merge\" output to this box.\n\n10. **Near-Miss Struggle Resolution:** A rectangular box labeled \"Near-Miss Struggle Resolution (3 paths: hesitation, decoding cluster, abandoned attempt)\" is placed to the right of the \"Omission Recovery\" box. It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"Omission Recovery\" output to this box.\n\n11. **Fragment Absorption:** A rectangular box labeled \"Fragment Absorption (BPE orphans into parent struggles, \u00b1150ms temporal containment)\" is placed to the right of the \"Near-Miss Struggle Resolution\" box. It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"Near-Miss Struggle Resolution\" output to this box.\n\n12. **Diagnostics:** A rectangular box labeled \"Diagnostics (long pauses, onset delays, self-corrections, prosody, pace consistency)\" is placed to the right of the \"Fragment Absorption\" box. It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"Fragment Absorption\" output to this box.\n\n13. **VAD Gap Analysis:** A rectangular box labeled \"VAD Gap Analysis (Silero VAD acoustic verification, overhang adjustment)\" is placed to the right of the \"Diagnostics\" box. It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"Diagnostics\" output to this box.\n\n14. **NL API Annotation + Proper Noun Forgiveness:** A rectangular box labeled \"NL API Annotation + Proper Noun Forgiveness (dictionary guard: Free Dict API 200/404)\" is placed to the right of the \"VAD Gap Analysis\" box. It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"VAD Gap Analysis\" output to this box.\n\n15. **Metrics:** A rectangular box labeled \"Metrics (WCPM, accuracy, WCPM range, tier breakdown)\" is placed to the right of the \"NL API Annotation + Proper Noun Forgiveness\" box. It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"NL API Annotation + Proper Noun Forgiveness\" output to this box.\n\n16. **Word Speed Map:** A rectangular box labeled \"Word Speed Map (phoneme-normalized via CMUdict 125K words, 8 tiers)\" is placed to the right of the \"Metrics\" box. It has a white background and a thin black border. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"Metrics\" output to this box.\n\n17. **UI Rendering:** On the far right, a rounded rectangle labeled \"UI Rendering (color-coded alignment, click-to-play tooltips, speed map, metric boxes)\" represents the final output. It's filled with a light peach gradient. A medium thickness dark gray arrow connects the \"Word Speed Map\" output to this box.\n\n**Groupings:**\n\n*   The entire pipeline could be enclosed within a very light pastel yellow (almost white) background rectangle with rounded corners to visually group all the components.\n*   The Kitchen Sink Ensemble is specifically grouped as described above.\n*   Consider grouping the \"Recovery and Struggle Resolution\" stages (Omission Recovery, Near-Miss Struggle Resolution, Fragment Absorption) with a very thin dashed border and a light pastel green background.\n\n**Labels and Annotations:**\n\n*   All labels use a clear, sans-serif font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica).\n*   The arrows are labeled implicitly, based on the box labels, so no explicit arrow labels are needed.\n*   Important mathematical notation (e.g., \"-1.5\u00d7(1-levRatio)\") is included within the relevant box to highlight the processing being done.\n\n**Input/Output:**\n\n*   **Input:** Audio Blob\n*   **Output:** UI Rendering (interactive display)\n\n**Styling:**\n\n*   **Background:** Predominantly pure white, with occasional use of very light pastel shades (yellow, green, blue, peach) for grouping and emphasis.\n*   **Color Palette:** Restrained; primarily blacks, grays, and the pastel accent colors mentioned above.\n*   **Line Weights:** Medium thickness for main flow arrows, slightly thinner for internal connections within the Kitchen Sink Ensemble.  Thin lines for borders of boxes.\n*   **Icon Styles:** No icons are used, favoring a clean and minimalist design.\n*   **Font:** Clean sans-serif font (e.g., Arial, Helvetica).\n",
