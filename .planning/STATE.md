### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags child speech WER (0.30-0.78) as fundamental risk. Phase 1 should validate STT accuracy with target population audio early.
- Dialect bias in ASR (WER 0.35 for Black speakers vs 0.19 for white) must be designed into error taxonomy from Phase 2, not bolted on later.
- STT timestamp precision needs empirical validation before building timing-dependent features (Phase 3 diagnostics).
