### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None for v1.0 — shipped.

**For v1.1+ consideration:**

- Child speech WER research flags accuracy risk; needs validation with target population
- Dialect bias in ASR should be monitored during real-world use
