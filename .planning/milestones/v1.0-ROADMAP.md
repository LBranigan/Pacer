# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-03
**Phases:** 1-9
**Total Plans:** 21

## Overview

ReadingQuest delivers automated oral reading fluency assessment by building up from a modularized codebase through the core alignment pipeline, layering diagnostics and OCR on top, persisting data for progress tracking, and finally delivering teacher and student interfaces. The critical path runs through alignment (Phase 2) -- nothing downstream works without accurate transcript-to-reference diff.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Existing monolithic HTML app is modularized into ES modules with manual text input working as a reference passage source. App is a PWA installable on classroom devices.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: INFR-01, INFR-05, INPT-01, INPT-03, INPT-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Modularize monolith into ES modules with extracted CSS
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Add PWA support (manifest, service worker, icons)

### Phase 2: Alignment & Core Metrics
**Goal**: App aligns STT transcript against reference text and computes core fluency metrics (WCPM, accuracy, word classification)
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: ALGN-01, ALGN-02, ALGN-03, CORE-01, CORE-02, CORE-03, CORE-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Text normalization, alignment engine, and metrics modules
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Wire pipeline and color-coded UI display

### Phase 3: Diagnostics
**Goal**: App detects fine-grained fluency challenges beyond simple word correctness -- onset delays, pauses, self-corrections, morphological struggles, and crude prosody signals
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: DIAG-01, DIAG-02, DIAG-03, DIAG-04, DIAG-05
**Plans**: 2 plans

- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Diagnostics computation module (all five analyzers)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Wire diagnostics into pipeline and render in UI

### Phase 4: OCR & Async STT
**Goal**: Teachers can photograph a book page to extract reference text, and passages longer than 60 seconds are handled via async STT
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: INPT-02, INFR-02
**Plans**: 2 plans

- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Google Vision OCR: image upload, text extraction, editable preview, use as reference passage
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Async STT: longrunningrecognize with polling, chunked sync fallback, duration-based routing

### Phase 5: Data Persistence
**Goal**: Assessment data persists across sessions with student profiles and history
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: INFR-03, INFR-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Storage module and HTML/CSS scaffolding for student profiles and history
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Wire storage into app, auto-save assessments, render history

### Phase 6: Teacher Dashboard & Standard Celeration Chart
**Goal**: Teachers can view assessment results, track student progress on an embedded Standard Celeration Chart (semi-log canvas), and replay audio synced to words
**Depends on**: Phase 2, Phase 5
**Requirements**: TCHR-01, TCHR-02, TCHR-05
**Plans**: 4 plans

- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Extend storage schema to v2 with rich assessment data and IndexedDB audio
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Port standalone celeration chart as ES module
- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — Dashboard UI with error breakdown and chart integration
- [x] 06-04-PLAN.md — Word-synced audio playback for teacher review

### Phase 7: Teacher Reporting & Benchmarks
**Goal**: Teachers can generate formal reports for RTI meetings and see how students compare to grade-level norms
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: TCHR-03, TCHR-04
**Plans**: 3 plans

- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Benchmarks module, storage v3 migration (grade field), student creation UI
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Dashboard benchmark indicators, grade selector, report button
- [x] 07-03-PLAN.md — Printable RTI report page with chart snapshot

### Phase 8: Student Experience
**Goal**: Students see a gamified, animated playback of their reading with a character that reacts to their performance
**Depends on**: Phase 2, Phase 3
**Requirements**: STUD-01, STUD-02, STUD-03
**Plans**: 3 plans

- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Pure logic modules: gamification scoring and sprite animator
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — Student playback page with audio-synced character animation
- [x] 08-03-PLAN.md — Gamified feedback UI, storage v4, entry point wiring

### Phase 9: NL API Integration
**Goal**: Enrich each reference word with NL-derived annotations (POS, entity type, word tier) to enable proper noun forgiveness, ASR healing, and tier-based error classification
**Depends on**: Phase 2, Phase 3
**Plans**: 1 plan (implemented directly)

- [x] Direct implementation — POS tagging, entity recognition, word tiers, proper noun forgiveness, ASR healing

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- diff-match-patch for word alignment with Unicode encoding technique
- Single orf_data localStorage key with versioned schema (v1→v5)
- IndexedDB for audio blob storage separate from localStorage
- PWA architecture for offline classroom use
- Google Cloud APIs: STT, Vision OCR, Natural Language
- Standard Celeration Chart ported from standalone project

**Issues Resolved:**
- Child speech ASR accuracy addressed via proper noun forgiveness and word tier classification
- OCR passage trimming solved via multi-start-position DP algorithm
- Long audio handled via async STT with chunked fallback

**Tech Debt Accepted:**
- Grade range mismatch: HT norms cover grades 1-6, UI offers 3-12 (graceful degradation)
- HT 2017 norms values from training data, flagged for manual verification
